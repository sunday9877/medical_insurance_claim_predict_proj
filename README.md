This project centers on predicting insurance claim approvals, a vital aspect impacting bothpatients and healthcare providers.  Utilizing data from 1,338 policyholders and examiningattributes such as age, gender, BMI, daily activity, location, insurance charges, and smokinghabits, our aim is to discern connections among these factors. The primary objective is toforecast whether insurance claims will be approved. Leveraging statistical methodologies likeLM, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, we seek to predict patient behavior concerningclaim approvals, empowering more informed decision-making in the healthcare domain. Theanalysis revealed that among the models evaluated, Random Forest emerged as the most robust,demonstrating superior performance in Precision, Recall, Accuracy, and F1 Score. Followingclosely, XGBoost exhibited competitive performance across all metrics, highlighting its eï¬€icacy.However, in this specific evaluation, Linear Regression (LM) showcased comparatively lowervalues across the assessed metrics.2
